Inworld AI MoE Proof of Concept for Generating AI Games 20XX

Welcome to the Inworld AI MoE Proof of Concept for Generating AI Games 20XX, a cutting-edge initiative by Flames Systems, inspired by the Cardinal System from Sword Art Online. This project is aimed at exploring the possibilities of AI-driven game development, utilizing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach in the C programming language.

Overview

The Inworld AI MoE project is designed to serve as a foundational step towards realizing the potential of AI in creating complex, dynamic, and engaging game environments. By leveraging a Mixture of Experts model, we aim to enable the AI to make informed decisions, craft intricate narratives, and generate game mechanics that adapt to player behavior in real-time.

Features

Dynamic Content Generation: Utilizing AI to dynamically generate game content, ensuring a unique experience for every player.
Adaptive Difficulty: The AI adjusts the game's difficulty based on the player's performance, maintaining a balanced challenge level.
Narrative Crafting: AI-driven storytelling, where the narrative evolves based on player choices and interactions.
Real-Time Learning: The system learns from player actions to continuously enhance the gaming experience.
